# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-of-CI-Capital-s-Loan-Portfolio-and-Economic-Impact
# Oveview
This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on three related tables: CI_customer, CI_loan, and CI_economics. These tables contain valuable information about customer profiles, loan details, and Indian macroeconomic parameters, respectively. The primary objective of this EDA is to gain insights into CI Capital's loan portfolio, customer behavior, and the impact of external economic factors on loan demand and defaults.

# Problem statement
CI Capital, a financial institution, wants to better understand its loan portfolio and customer behavior to make informed decisions and develop strategies for business growth and risk management. The project aims to answer key questions and explore various aspects of the data to achieve this objective. Here are the main questions and tasks addressed in this project:

1.) Identify Loan Types: Determine the different types of loans offered by CI Capital.

2.) Loan Distribution: Calculate the number of loans for each loan type to identify gaps and target areas for improvement.

3.) Customer Age Analysis: Analyze the distribution of loans by customer age groups, focusing on customers below 30 years old.

4.) Credit Score Analysis: Identify the loan types with a higher risk of defaults by examining loans with credit scores below a certain threshold, such as 580.

5.) Income and Default Analysis: Investigate the relationship between income and loan defaults by calculating the average income of customers with credit scores above 700 who have defaulted.

6.) Marital Status and Credit Score Analysis: Explore the relationship between marital status and credit scores by calculating the average credit score for different marital statuses, including widowers.

7.) Education Level and Default Analysis: Examine the impact of education level on loan defaults by counting the number of customers with five or more defaults for each education level, with a specific focus on customers pursuing Masters education.

8.) Economic Factors and Loan Demand: Create a report showing the relationship between the number of loans granted each month and the respective unemployment rate. This report will help CI Capital understand how external factors like GDP and unemployment affect loan demand.

The project involves exploring these aspects of the data to provide valuable insights and recommendations to CI Capital for informed decision-making and policy development.
